          Web developers have wanted to use video and audio on the Web for a long time, ever since the early 2000s, when we started
          to have bandwidth fast enough to support any kind of video (video files are much larger than text or even images.)
          In the early days, native web technologies such as HTML didn't have the ability to embed video and audio on the
          Web, so proprietary (or plugin-based) technologies like Flash (and later, Silverlight) became popular for handling
          such content. This kind of technology worked ok, but it had a number of problems, including not working well with
          HTML/CSS features, security issues, and accessibility issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          A native solution would solve much of this if done right. Fortunately, a few years later the HTML5 specification had such
          features added, with the video and audio elements, and some shiny new JavaScript APIs for controlling them. We'll
          not be looking at JavaScript here — just the basic foundations that can be achieved with HTML.

        <h1>The video element</h1>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>The video element allows you to embed a video very easily. A really simple example looks like this:</p>
        <pre><code>
        &lt;video&gt; src="rabbit320.webm" controls> &lt;p&gt;Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a &lt;a href="rabbit320.webm"&gt;link to the video&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/video&gt;</code></pre>

      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Supporting_Multiple_Formats">
      <header>
        <h1>Supporting Multiple Formats</h1>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          There's a problem with the above example, which you may have noticed already if you've tried to access the live link above
          with a browser like Safari or Internet Explorer. The video won't play! This is because different browsers support
          different video (and audio) formats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's go through the terminology quickly. Formats like MP3, MP4 and WebM are called container formats. They contain different
          parts that make up the whole song or video — such as an audio track, a video track (in the case of video), and
          metadata to describe the media being presented.
        </p>
        <p>
          The audio and video tracks are also in different formats, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A WebM container usually packages Ogg Vorbis audio with VP8/VP9 video. This is supported mainly in Firefox and
            Chrome.
          </li>
          <li>
            An MP4 container often packages AAC or MP3 audio with H.264 video. This is supported mainly in Internet Explorer and Safari.
          </li>
          <li>
            The older Ogg container tends to go with Ogg Vorbis audio and Ogg Theora video. This was supported mainly in Firefox and
            Chrome, but has basically been superceded by the better quality WebM format.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre>
          <code>
              &lt;video controls&gt;
              &lt;source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
              &lt;source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm"&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a &lt;a href="rabbit320.mp4"&gt;link to the video&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/video&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Other_video_features">
      <header>
        <h1>Other video features</h1>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          There are a number of other features you can include on an HTML5 video. Take a look at our third example, below:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
              &lt;video controls width="400" height="400"
              autoplay loop muted
              poster="poster.png"&gt;
              &lt;source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
              &lt;source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm"&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a &lt;a href="rabbit320.mp4"&gt;link to the video&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
       </video>
          </code>
        </pre>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="The_audio_element">
      <header>
        <h1>The audio element</h1>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The audio element works in exactly the same way as the video element, with a few small differences as outlined below. A typical
          example might look like so:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
              &lt;audio controls&gt;
              &lt;source src="viper.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
              &lt;source src="viper.ogg" type="audio/ogg"&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is a &lt;a href="viper.mp3"&gt;link to the audio&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/audio&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This takes up less space than a video player, as there is no visual component — you just need to display controls to play
          the audio. Other differences from HTML5 video are as follows:
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Displaying_video_text_tracks">
      <header>
        <h1>Displaying video text tracks</h1>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Now we'll discuss a slightly more advanced concept that is really useful to know about. Many people can't or don't want to
          hear the audio/video content they find on the Web, at least at certain times. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Many people have auditory impairments (more commonly known as hard of hearing, or deaf) so can't hear the audio.</li>
          <li>Others may not be able to hear the audio because they are in noisy environments (like a crowded bar when a sports
            game is being shown) or might not want to disturb others if they are in a quiet place (like a library.)</li>
          <li>People who don't speak the language of the video might want a text transcript or even translation to help them
            understand the media content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
              &lt;video controls&gt;
              &lt;source src="example.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
              &lt;source src="example.webm" type="video/webm"&gt;
              &lt;track kind="subtitles" src="subtitles_en.vtt" srclang="en"&gt;
              &lt;/video&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
